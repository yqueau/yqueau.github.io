Thin details meet large-scale 3D-reconstruction: Photometric Stereo for Cultural Heritage - IAMAHA conference, Nice, Nov. 28th, 2023
------

I gave a talk with Jean MÃ©lou (IRIT) at the IAMAHA conference (artificIAl intelligence and applied MAthematics for History and Archaeology). Our presentation tackles the problem of 3D-reconstruction when the scene contains is both large-scale and exhibiting fine-scale details. Through examples on two cultural heritage masterpieces (the Chauvet cave and the Bayeux Tapestry), we show how to combine photometric and geometric 3D-reconstruction techniques, and how to create a [2.5D panorama](https://redonmarjorie.github.io/projects/BayeuxPanorama.html) which can be explored in a web interface.
