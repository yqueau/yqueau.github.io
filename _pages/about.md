Bio
------

I am a CNRS research scientist in the [Image team](https://www.greyc.fr/en/equipes/image-2/) of [GREYC laboratory](https://www.greyc.fr/) in Caen (France). I obtained my PhD in computer science from the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse in 2015. Before joining the CNRS I was a post-doc in [Daniel Cremer's group](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/) in TU Munich (Germany), and then an associate professor with [LabISEN](https://isen-brest.fr/labisen/) in Brest (France). My primary research interest is inverse problems in computer vision, and their solving using variational methods and deep learning.
